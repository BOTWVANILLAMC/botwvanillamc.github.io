# SERVER INFO

Info Page for the Vanilla-esque 1.16.1 Minecraft Server at: `147.135.181.214:25587` for the BOTW Modding Community! **Due to almost immediate griefing the whitelist has been enabled, contact NoPyro#6891 on discord for verification and server access.**

## MODPACK FILES

The server uses a few [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/use/){:target="_blank"} mods for some additional features, you can grab a MultiMC Instance or a Twitch Modpack at these links. The Twitch Modpack may also be downloaded straight from the Twitch Client, this is heavily recommended:

[MultiMC Instance](https://github.com/BOTWVANILLAMC/botwvanillamc.github.io/raw/master/BOTW%20Vanilla%20-%20MMC.zip){:target="_blank"}

[Twitch Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/zmd-modpack/files/3001994){:target="_blank"}
